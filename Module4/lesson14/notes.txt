# steps to debug

k describe
k logs

# if exit code is 0, describe should help, it was terminated and did not even send logs most likely. 
# if it's not 0, than logs will be helpful

# Pods
Pending: created in etcd, but some prereq conditions ot been met
Completed: Pod completed it's work
Failed: the Pod has finished and somethng gone wrong
CrashLoopbackOff: Pod has failed and cluster restarted it. Or it could be that the App in Container copleted the process, end scheduler trying to crate it again, and it's completed again - like quick shell command.
Unknown: status could not be obtained
