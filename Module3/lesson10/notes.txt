# Storages
Every Pod can have strage attached. Persistant Storage can be attached directly, for development and debuging.
In Production systems it's recommended to have PVC (Persistanc Volume Claim) which will request a storage.
Than PVC could be BOUND aither to Persistant Volume created by administrator or could be auto created by Kubernetes "Storage Provisioner", using Storageclass dynamicly. 

# Pod Volume Storage
pod.spec.volumes
* emptyDir and hostPath are common for testing
* to mount: pod.spe.containers.volumeMounts

kubectl explain pod.spec.volumes

# PV Persistant Volume
Could be local directory or other types

# PVC 
One PV can be used by single PVC. 
If not match, storage class will try to create one

Pod "PersistentVolumeclaim - name: ..." --- volumes: name: ..., persisnetVolumeClaim: claimName 
> Mount containers: volumeMounts: name: ref -> volumes: name > PVC > PV

# get StorageClasses which would create PVs if requested from PVC
kubectl get storageclass

We can storageClassName: ... as a selector, to make sure that PV and PVC are bound together based on equal storageClassName
